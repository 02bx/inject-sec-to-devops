<details><summary>`Detect-secrets` (https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)</summary>

detect-secrets is an aptly named module for detecting secrets within a code base.

**Features:**
- There are three components that you can setup, depending on your purposes.
- Client-side Pre-Commit Hook, that alerts developers when they attempt to enter a secret in the code base.
- Server-side Secret Scanning, to periodically scan tracked repositories, and make sure developers didn't accidentally skip the pre-commit check.
